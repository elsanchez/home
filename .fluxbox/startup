# fluxbox startup file
# By this point, X has called startfluxbox.
# The goal of this file is to:
#    * set a custom fluxbox environment
#    * start apps before starting fluxbox
#    * start fluxbox
#    * start apps after fluxbox has started
#    * wait until fluxbox exits
#    * perform various tasks after fluxbox exits
# Hence, this is a shell script which at some point execs and waits fluxbox.
# All other persistent apps should be run in the background with &.
